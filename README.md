# Shared-Preferences-Demo
Simple mobile application that demonstrates the use of shared preferences to store data.

 Users can submit entries with the input text box and submit button. 
 The first entry wil receive a key of 0 and the global variable will then increment so 
 each entry will receive a key one unit greater than the last entry. 
 Users can retrieve the entries by typing the corresponding key in the output key text 
 box and the retrieve button. The clear button will delete all user data.
