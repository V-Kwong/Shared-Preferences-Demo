# Shared-Preferences-Demo
Simple mobile application that demonstrates the use of shared preferences to store data.

 Users can submit entries with the input text box and submit button. 
 The first entry wil receive a key of 1 and the sharedpreferences array_index variable will 
 then increment so each entry will receive a key one unit greater than the last entry. 
 Users can retrieve the entries by typing the corresponding key in the output key text 
 box and the retrieve button. The clear button will delete all user data.
 
 The "List of Entries" button will take you to a second activity that displays all entries submitted.
 Clicking any entry will delete it and the keys will be decremented such that the entry keys start
 at 1 and increment until the last entry submitted.
